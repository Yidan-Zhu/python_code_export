And in those days I was a fitness enthusiast. And it seemed she was trying to impress me. I never observed it. Truth is I wasn't very fond of her because she was – She was a charming girl until she opened her mouth. She was a chatterbox. Goodness, she could talk. Then she left a message one day saying she was going to run away because he was always scolding her about me. He arrived at my apartment. Big intimidating look on his face. I managed to calm him down. and proposed “Well we'll search for her and if we can't locate her well you can – do whatever you think is right.” I was strategizing. So he accepted my offer. And we went to where they found her scarf – near a park. and we traced down a little more and we couldn't locate her. And returned – it was a police station – she was sitting on a chair with a book in her hands. She hadn't run away. But – nevertheless – that resolved the issue for that day. But that evening the deputy, Frank Mitchell, said “You better transfer and leave because that old man never forgets anything once he gets it into his mind.” And I did. I transferred. and left.

            "Let me share a story from when I was twenty-two years old, just fresh out of college. I was staying in a small town about five miles from here. I had just started my first job at a local bookstore. It was a quiet afternoon, and I was alone in the store. My grandpa, who had been bedridden for almost a year, was at home with my sister. She had to care for him daily, as he couldn't move around on his own. There were only two of us siblings, my sister and me. My parents had gone out of town for the weekend. As I was shelving books, I suddenly heard a voice inside my head. It said, \"If you go to the old church down the street and light a candle for your grandpa, he will get better.\" I looked around the bookstore, but no one was there. I continued with my work, trying to ignore the voice. It spoke to me again, repeating the same message. I looked around once more, but still found no one. I decided to take a break and walk to the church. I was only a short distance away, maybe a quarter-mile. As I approached the church, I hesitated for a moment. I was not a particularly religious person. I remembered my grandma always saying that prayers from a sincere heart could bring miracles. On the other hand, she also said that prayers without faith were useless. I admitted to myself that I was far from being a saint. I had my share of mistakes and misdeeds. I thought about my grandpa and how much he meant to our family. Finally, I went inside the church and found a candle. I knelt down in front of the altar. I said, \"God, I don't know how to pray properly. But I am asking you with all my heart to heal my grandpa. Please help him regain his strength and guide us in taking care of him.\" After saying my prayer, I returned to the bookstore. I resumed my work, shelving books. Suddenly, I felt a strong urge to go home. It was as if something was pulling me towards the house. I didn't hear any voice this time. It was just an overwhelming feeling that I needed to go. I locked up the store and rushed home. To my surprise, I found my grandpa sitting in the living room, talking to my sister. He hadn't been able to leave his bed for months without assistance. My sister told me that he had suddenly felt a surge of energy and was able to stand up and walk. That day marked the beginning of his recovery. He gradually regained his strength and independence. It was a turning point in our lives. We became more grateful for the time we had together. I often thought back to that day in the church. I wondered if my prayer had anything to do with my grandpa's recovery. I couldn't be sure, but it definitely changed my perspective on faith and the power of prayer. My grandpa lived for many more years after that incident. He celebrated his ninetieth birthday surrounded by family and friends. We cherished every moment we had with him. That experience happened almost twenty years ago. It remains a vivid memory in my mind. My grandpa passed away a few years later, but his spirit lives on in our hearts. Sometimes, when I'm feeling lost or uncertain, I think back to that day. I remember the power of faith and the miracles it can bring. And I am reminded that we are never truly alone, even when it seems like we are.\n",

I looked around the store and there definitely wasn\\'t anyway else in there with me. I wasn\\'t a overtly religious person nor would I call myself a saint. I decided that I would go to the church, I entered, lit a candle, and said a prayer. I then went back to the store. I had this overwhelmingly feeling that I needed to go home and I closed up shop. When I got home I saw that my grandpa sitting in the living room. My sister informed me that he had got there himself, he hadn\\'t been able to get out of bed unassisted in months.

            "We moved down to Third and uh Wharton. We had gotten moved but it was like – you remember I told you my father drank but it was still day and after he had gotten in and put the furniture where it was supposed to go my mother left to go to market to get some food to bring into the house. And my father went to take the horses – take the team of horses back. But he didn't come home. He – uh – I stopped somewhere on – I dunno but he – that's where – how he – why he wasn't in the house. And of course I was left there with the kids. Well no sooner did my mother get out of the house – my father went first – then – oh it was such an awful crash came through the window. And I – and I looked and it was a big stone. And then of course they – they – well they stoned the house. And I had sense enough to get the kids into the stairway so that they wouldn't get hurt by flyin' gla- glass. And I said to them “Now you stay there. Don't move 'cause nothing will reach you here. And I'm gonna go and see if I can find mom” – (We call our mother mom.) And they were crying and carryin' on. I was scared to death I really was frightened out of my wits. And I didn't know what to do but I remember saying a prayer as I went out the front door because I didn't know what was gonna hit me when I went out that door. And I ran – I was ten years old at the time this happened – I ran to Fourth street because I knew my mother wa- They had push carts in those days on Fourth street. And it was a Jewish neighborhood and they – they stayed open until – until all hours. Because they would you know however much money they could get they wanted. So uh that's where she was going to do her shopping. And I finally found my mother. I did find her. And while I was trying to tell her what had happened a policeman went by. And my voice was such that you could hardly make out what I was saying. I was so nervous and – and – my voice was shaking so and he wanted to find out what ha- what was wrong with me. And then when he understood what the situation was he turned to my mother and says “This is a bad neighborhood. It's Irish.” And he said “Th- they're known to do things like that Better move out of there.” My mother said “I just moved in how am I gonna move out?” He says “I dunno.” He says “But they don't want any black people in there.” An' he didn't say black 'cause they didn't use black then. But “they don't want anybody in there.” So uh she said “Well you're the law. You're supposed to protect us.” He says “I can't do anything with it.” He was Irish himself. “I can't do anything about it.” So my mother said um “Where is the uh precinct you work from?” And he told her. I forgot now. I was right there with her but I've forgotten where he told her. So uh she said “Well if you can't do anything to help me I'll go see who – if I can't find someone else to help me.” Well in those days black people were so cowed by circumstances an' uniforms an' – an' – an' white people you know they uh many times didn't assert themselves. But thankfully my mother was not one of those kind. And uh she – well I always thought of her as an educated person which she was because she was the only one I knew who had completed high school. She went to Lackawanna uh high school. And uh this was – let me see what year was this happening – well it must have been nineteen twenty-five so you can see what – what the times were. And we went – she took me and we went to the police station. And they also had police wagons with horses attached to them. Believe it or not in those days. [break in the recording] So my mother said to the captain “What are you going to do about it?” And he says “Well lady there's nothing we can do about it.” And she says “You mean to tell me that I have to live under those circumstances and there's nothing that you can do about it?” She says – he says “Well uh uh the only thing I can tell you to do is to move.” He says “Because” – uh he said to me “Did you see anyone?” And I said “No.” He says “Well how can – how can you” – to my mother – “how can you do anything if you don't know who – who to put the blame on?” An' he says “I'm sure there was more than uh than one person.” So my mother said “Well I don't know what I'm going to do.” She says “But one thing I know I'm not going to do is move. Because I have no money to move with.” They took all we had to to pay the rent. In that house you had to pay uh in advance. And she said “If they didn't want me there they should not have rented the house to me. Now the real estate agent should be accountable.” So anyhow she said to him “Well I know one thing you can do.” And he says “What's that?” She says “You can take me home.” He said “Take you home?” She said “Yes in the police patrol.” So – I-I guess they figured “Let's get this lady out of here because she's talking loud and long.” And they had never come up with anybody like that. So they put us in the police patrol and they took us home. We weren't far from from – from where it was – maybe Fifth street – from where we had moved. And uh – course with the horses and the police patrol and the clang – they had a bell that clanged. Clang clang clang – you know they told you about the trolley that went “Clang.” Well this police patrol that bell they had it went “Clang clang clang.” And um all the neighbors came running out to see what was happening. And of course they saw the man came around the back – I can r- see it right now – from where he was sitting up front there where the horses came around and opened the door in the back. And they had a long door in the back where you had to come down steps to get out the back of the – of this police patrol. Well we got out of that police patrol – Before the patrol ever left my mother turned and faced all those people that were standing around and she says “Why you're doing this to me I don't know.” She says “I know that I am different from you color wise but in every other respect I'm just the same as you are and all I'm trying to do is provide a home for my family.” She told them that they had rented the house she told them how much money she had paid she had told them that was all the money she had. And they had paid that rent for a month. She knew she was going to be there for the month. She did not know beyond the month. Whether they'd have enough mother – money to pay it for the next month. But she knew they were going to be there for for the month. She said “It is winter time and it is cold. And I cannot afford to be buying windows.” “Now” she said “Whoever threw the stones I don't know. But you can all see what has happened. And now I'm telling you that we're going to be here for a month. So you might just as well make up your mind to that. If you don't want me here then you people get together and give me enough money to move somewhere else. because I do not have it.” Well of course you know they didn't do that. They probably didn't have any money either. So in the meantime – not in the meantime but during during the period of time that we were there my father became sick. And the neighbors were as nice as anybody could ever have been. When there was trouble they responded just like anyone else. But that was our welcoming to the neighborhood. And it was terrible and it certainly was frightening for me.\n",

            "[\"This black family moved from a Jewish to an Irish neighbourhood. When they arrived someone stoned their windows. As the father was drunk, the narrator ran to find the Mum who they thought would know how to resolve the situation given her schooling at Lackanawny. The 'Mom' sought and found a policeman on the street. He said he would like to help but there was nothing he could do even though, or in spite of, he was Irish too. So they went to the station on 5th and explained the situation, how they had the windows stoned, how it would make their place unbearable in the cold of winter as they had no money to fix it; the police at the station also said there was nothing they could do but did offer her a ride back in the police wagon, a wagon still driven by horses even though it was 1925. They were thankful she accepted as she talked long and hard. Clang, Clang clang went the bells as they went down the street which caused all the neighbours to come onto the street upon the wagon's arrival to see what the fuss was about. The mother took the opportunity to explain to those gathered that she had used all the family money to pay a full months rent so she was staying the month, in these cold winter days she was, colour aside, just like them in that she wanted to put a roof over her children's head and if the locals didn't want them there because they were black then they'd have to provide the money for them to move on. Naturally, this didn't happen, as likely the locals were in the same financial predicament however after this episode they became much friendlier, helping out wherever possible in times of need such as when the drunken father became ill.\", \"A family moved into a house in a new neighbourhood. After they had moved in, the father took the horses away and the mother went shopping. While the narrator was at home with the other children, their house was attacked and stones were thrown through the window.  Once the narrator had hidden the children he went to find his mother at the Jewish shop, which stayed open late and served anyone. Once the shopkeeper had heard what had happened he told yhe mother that they lived in a bad neighbourhood and should leave. The mother said she couldn't leave because she had used all her money for the first month's rent. The mother went to the police to complain and they also told her to leave. It was an Irish neighbourhood in the 1920s and, because they were black, they would never fit in. The mother insisted the police drive her home. When she got home, she addressed the neighbours - explaining that she had no money to move and they were stuck with her for the month and better get used to the idea. After that the neighbours were much friendlier and even helped when the father got sick\", \"The child was in the house when the parents were out. The father was drinking in the day time and the mother was out shopping in the market.

They spoke to a policeman who said he couldn't help and they would have to move. The mother said they could not move and asked where his precinct was. they went to the precinct and they said the same thing. The mother insisted they drive them back to the house where she told the rest of the neighbours that if they wanted them to move, they would have to give her the money to move. Nobody did.

They were black and they had troubles with the people in the neighborhood who were throwing rocks at their windows. The child who was left at home was scared and tried to call his mother. But she did not answer, he waited until he thought it was safe and then came out of his hiding spot. His mother got home and he told her everything that happened. They then called the police, and the police told them that they could do nothing about it. They told them because they are black and this is an Irish neighborhood, they should just move out because the circumstances won't change. The mother was very smart from a very well known high school and told the policeman that she will not move because she does not have enough money. The police insisted on them moving. And she spent the whole time telling them that they don't have any money. The police then offered to take them home because they were tired of her speaking, as she was the first person who actually spoke out on the situation. As they were going out, there were people surrounding them telling them that they had to move out. And they mother said that in order for them to move out all of them had to come up with enough money for a month's rent as they had to pay for that house in advance and she does not have the money to move anywhere else.

A policeman heard them tell what had happened and said it’s a neighbourhood of Irish people and they don’t want you there because you are black - he didn’t actually say the word black. This was in 1925 and the narrator was 10. The mother asked which precinct he worked from and they went there. She spoke to someone there who told her she was best to pack up and leave, which she couldn’t afford to do. She made them give a lift home with the police patrol and when they arrived she spoke to the crowd. She said you don’t want me here but I am paid for a month. If you want us out then you need to give us the money to go. Of course the neighbours didn’t. The mother was educated and had been to Lackawanna high school. Later then the dad was ill, the neighbours rallied round.', 'This is a story of a family that moved to a new neighbourhood and a ten year old is telling us how they were welcomed by a flock of people who threw stones in their house and broke windows.

Her mother asked what precinct he was from and he told her, although the narrator didn't remember.  Likely on Fifth.

I went out run to the fourth  street it was not far from where we had moved to. I found my mother and the policemen passed by and I told him what had happened and he said he could not help us with anything. He said we should move but he insisted that he could not help us because they people in that area were Irish and did not want black people there. My mother said we should go to the police station to find someone who could help us but the officer in charge said he could not help us as well.so my mother asked the police officer to take us home with their cart which had a bell which goes clang clang clang. So when we approached our area everyone rushed outside to see when the door was opened for us a lot of people where standing outside and my mother addressed them. My mother told them how much we were charged for rent and said if they wanted us to move they can all contributed money so that we could move and no one contributed. From then there were nice to us  but the welcome was frightening. ', \"It's a story about a boy who recently moved to Third and Wharton with his mother.

He took the kids to a safe place. The boy was scared and he took the phone to call his mother. He prayed for their safety.  The boy was ten years old when this happened. He ran to Fourth Street to look for his mother. It was a Jewish neighborhood. He found his mother on the way but couldn't talk as the police man appeared. The police man asked the mother's boy to move out of the neighborhood because it was dangerous, they don't want black people there. His mother refused and told him that they have just moved in. The police couldn't help his mother.\", \"We moved house down to fifth and Burnham. We started moving the furniture but my father said it would not all fit but we got it in. My father went to take back the horses after we finished with them. He had not returned so my mother went to look for him. In the meantime some people came and smashed the windows of the house with rocks but luckily none of us got hurt but after that I went to find my mama, she was near by. After that we made it to the local police and asked for help but they said that there was nothing that could be done as we had not seen anybody and didn't even know how many people there was. My mama ended up just asking for the police to take us home which they agreed to. When we got back all the local Irish community gathered round and then my mama spoke telling everybody that she might be black but she is just the same as everybody else in the area and she and her family were not going to move out as they had no money left.

The people in the community threw stones at our windows and they got broken so I searched high and low for my mother. When I had explained to her what happened she reported it to the police officer. The police officer said there's nothing much he can do. He suggested we move. But my mom told him that we had just moved from where we were staying and now we should move again because this community doesn't like the color of our skin. She told him that we are the same people just a different color of skin. She continued to tell him how she paid a month's rent so she's not moving. If these people want her to move they should give her money to do so because she doesn't have any. She also said that the agent should've not taken her money because she knows how this community will react to our family staying there. The police officer told my mom that the people of this community don't have money either and therefore can't give any to her so she can leave. My mom said she will stay the entire month because she paid for it. The community will have to accept them. \", \"We were at third and wharton and father had gone out and mother had gone to the market to buy some food. I was in the house with the children and people started throwing rocks through the window and there was a big crash. I realised what was happening and put the children under the stairs to shelter there. Mother had gone to fourth street to buy food at the market. It was a jewish market and they were open all hours to make as much money as they could. I decided to go find her at the market, I didn't know what was going to happen when I got outside so I said a prayer and then ran all the way there. When I got there I found her and I was trying to tell her what happened but I was so upset my voice was such that she couldn't understand. While I was there a policeman walked by and stopped to see what was happening and we told him. Mother said what are you going to do about it and he said the only thing to do is to move. She said I'm not going to move because I only just moved there. He said it's an Irish neighbourhood and they dont want any black people there. Well he didn't say black, he just said they don't want anybody there. She asked him what precinct he is from to find someone else who would help us and he told us but I can't remember where it was. We went there and spoke to the captain and said what are you going to do about it and he said nothing and said you have to move, same as the other policeman. Mother said well I know one thing you can do and that is to take us home. The policeman took us back to the house from about 5th street and when we got there he got out and helped mother down from the door. All the people were there standing outside and she said to them you all know whats happened and I don't know who did it but I do know I'm not going to move. I just moved in here and spent all my money to rent this house for a month and don't have any more money. You might as well make up your minds that I will be here for this month and if you want me to move then you all can put your money together for me. It is winter and cold and I don't have any money to be buying windows. I don't even know if I will have enough money to stay here for another month. After that the neighbours we very friendly and my dad got sick while we were living there and everyone wanted to help us and was kind. That was my introduction to the neighbourhood and it was terrifying.\", 'We moved to Forth and Wharton. My father drank. He took the horses. My mother went to the shops and left me with then kids. Stones broke to windows and I took the kids somewhere safe and then went to get my mother. I was 10 years old and did not know if I would be hit. The shops were open late and I reach my mother. I could hardly tell her what happens my voice failed me. A policemen came and said that he could do nothing it was a bad neighbourhood Irish and they did not like black people. We should move out My mother who was educated and had finished High School said she had only just moved in and could not afford to move out. She wanted to know where precint was. The Captain she spoke to said that he could do nothing.  My mother said that one thing they could do is give us a lift home in a police wagon. We went back in a police wagon that went clank, clank clank pulled by horses.  When we got home my mother addressed the crowd saying that she had only just moved in and had paaid the rent so had nothing left.  If they want her to move out they should pay her rent. They did not do that.  Later my dad fell ill and the neighbours were really nice.', 'We moved in to Third and Warton and not long after my dad got drunk and went out back to try and take the horses out. My mother had gone to the store to get some groceries on Fourth, not long after my mom, we call mother mom had gone to the store and my father had gone out - there was stones being thrown at our house, I quickly moved my siblings to hide under the stairwell, I told them \"Do not move because you will be safe here and no stone will hit you\". I was very frightened but prepared myself to go look for my mother, but was not sure what would happen immediately I stepped through the door and ran to Fourth as that\\'s where the carts where being pushed, I looked for my mom and found her and while trying to explain what had happened, a police officer happened to pass by, so after I composed myself a bit, I explained to him what had happened and all he could say to my mother and I was \"You have to move\" the town is Irish, my mom being angry and asked how he could say something like that and explained we had only moved here recently and she doesn\\'t have money to move again. The officer said he could not do anything as it sort of a norm here as we are black, he didn\\'t say black because they didn\\'t say that then but that\\'s basically what he meant, the officer was Irish as well. My mom angrily asked for his station and to speak to the captain. We went over to the police station which wasn\\'t too far from where we were, it was on Fifth. We entered and demanded to speak to the captain, we explained the situation and he basically said the same thing as the police officer. I was surprised and impressed by my mom, she stood her ground as she was more educated having gone to school in nineteen twenty-five. She explained to the captain that we have only moved here and have no money to go someplace else, and he said there was not much he could do as there was no one to blame, he also asked me if it was possible that there have been multiple people, which would make it harder to but the blame on someone. My mother suggested arresting the real estate agents as they sold the property to her despite knowing the situation in the town. My mother then said the least they could do was to drop off home and since the captain was tired of us being there because the conversation was long and loud he agreed. We went into the station patrol vehicle that had a bell attached to it and made a  \"Clang clang clang\" sound as we moved, during the journey, due to the bell a number of people came out of their homes to watch what was going on. When we reached our house, my mom turned to address the people watching, she said we had just moved here and paid money for rent for the month and that we were going to stay for the month and that after that she didn\\'t know, she also told them apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same people and that they should get used to us being here. She also suggested that if they all really wanted us to leave they should donate money for the family to move somewhere else, which they didn\\'t because they probably didn\\'t have any money either. After that day, everyone seemed to be nicer and even when my dad was sick they helped and offered whatever they had just like anyone else would. It was all good but my first initially welcome to that area was terrible!', \"The family had moved into a new neighbourhood and had paid the rent a month up front. The father had gone to tend to the horses and then some people came and threw stones at the house. The family were all afraid and so they fled. they asked for help in a Jewish neighbourhood and then were directed to a police station. The police were unhelpful initially and told the family the solution was to move. the mother explained that due to financial reasons this was impossible. She insisted that the police take them home and so they w=rode in the back of the police wagon with the bell clanging. They arrived home and climbed down the back steps of the wagon to be met by several neighbours watching. The mother gave an impassioned speech about how, despite their colour they were just the same as everyone else. This changed people's opinions and they then helped and supported the family even when the Father became ill. \", \"It happened in 1925. The narrator was 10. The father was day drinking and out of the house, after he'd moved their furniture into the house. The mother was out shopping. A rock crashed through the windows of the house. The children hid in the hallway to avoid the glass. The oldest of the children ran out of the house to Fourth Street, where the mother was. There, they found a policeman. He told them that this was a bad neighbourhood, and that they should move. He was Irish. The mother told him that they didn't have any money to move, and they had just moved into the house. He said there was nothing he could do. She was a smart black woman, the only one in her family to have finished high school. She asked where the nearest police station was, so that she could ask someone who would be able to do something. At the station, she got the same answer: that there was nothing to be done, except move. She then told them there was one thing they could do: to drive them home in the patrol car. They did. The car made such a clanging noise that all of their neighbours came out of their houses to see what was happening. When she got out of the police car, the mother announced to the neighbours that she knows she looks different due to having different skin colour, but that they could only afford to stay in the house a month. Perhaps they would get enough money to afford to stay another month, but in the meantime, the neighbours only had to put up with them for a month. She didn't know who threw the rock, she told them, but it was winter and it was cold, and she couldn't afford new windows. She said that she had no money to move right away, but if they wanted, the neighbours could give her the money to move. They didn't do that, but afterwards, when the father got sick, they were kind and courteous to the family.\", \"A black family moved to an all white neighbourhood and someone through a stone through their window in protest. The mother went to the police station to complain but they didn't want to do anything since it was a white irish neighbourhood. The mother was upset after paying a month's rent, knowing she and her family would have to stay so she told the police to escort her home so the neighbours would all come out to see her with the police (there was a loud bell attached to the police wagon so all neighbours heard it and came outside to watch) When the neighbors were outside the Mom announced that she had no money to move so the neighbours could give her money to move or put up with them. In the end the neighbours came around even being there for the family when the Dad got sick, but it was a scary beginning to moving into the white neighbourhood for this black family \", \"The story is about a ten year old child in a Black family in 1925. One day they come home, and after their parents go out (their father to fetch some horses, their mother to shop at the local Jewish market which stays open late), someone throws a stone through the window of their home, smashing the glass and scaring the child and their siblings. They go to find their mother, and encounter a policeman. The child and their mother complain to the policeman about what happens; the policeman blames the Irish neighbourhood, being Irish himself, and attributes it to them not wanting Black neighbours. He says he can't do anything about it, so the mother insists on attending his precinct, and speaking to his captain. The captain also claims not to be able to help, so the mother asks him to drive them home in the patrol vehicle. They're dropped off near their home, the noise of the vehicle draws out their neighbours, and she addresses them all, telling them that if they don't want her and her family there, they should pay for them to move house, as she can't afford it, and will be there for at least a month. Thereafter, the neighbours are kind to them, especially when the child's father is sick, but the child holds onto the memory of that frightening welcome to the neighbourhood.\", \"A man is recalling a time when, as a ten year old, having just moved to a new rental unit in an Irish neighborhood. He's alone and his mom is at the market and stones start to fly through the windows. He hides his siblings under the stairs and runs out to the market to find his mother. She approaches a police officer who tells her that black people aren't welcome in Irish neighborhoods, and that there's nothing he can do. She tells him that she will go to the precinct and find someone who can help. The man recalls her mother as being unusual among black people of the time in that she was not afraid to confront authority or people in uniforms. When she talks to the police chief at the precinct he repeats the same advice- to move and that he can't help her as she hasn't identified the suspect. She tells him all her money has gone to rent and she can't afford to move. She asks for a ride home, and the officer agrees. She confronts her neighbors, tells them she's paid for a month and can't afford to move anywhere else, and that she will not be moving, and can't afford new windows. She reminds the neighborhood that she's fundamentally the same as them despite her difference in color- that she's trying to look after her family and make ends meet.\", \"A family moved into an area that I presume to be white.  They were a family of colour. There were horses involved at the start of the story. Their house, which was rented, was damaged by stones - which they didn't have the money to fix.

After being brought home my police, the family confronted the neighbours who were watching their return and stated that if they were not wanted in the neighbourhood, they could all scrape together some cash for them to move.

She said \"You\\'re civil service, you must protect us\". He said that he couldn\\'t do that - he was Irish too. My mother asked \"Where is the precinct you work\". He told her, but I don\\'t remember the exact details, even though I was standing with my mother. We went to the precinct and spoke to the head officer, but he told my mother the same thing \"Move away\". She explained the situation to him, but he said he couldn\\'t help. She finally said \"The least you can do is drive me home\". So he did. The police car, hors and cart, mad a clanging sound. Clang clang clang. As we turned the corner - the precinct wasn\\'t far, maybe on Fifth - everyone turned and came out of their homes to hear the noise. The policeman sat up front, and we were let out the wide back door of the cart. As my mother got out she turned to face all the people and asked \"Why do you do this to me? We are the same, maybe not color wise, but in every other respect, we are the same. I have spent all of my savings on moving here. We are living here for a month at least, I don\\'t have enough to move away. I am just trying to provide a home for my family. I don\\'t have enough money to fix my windows, so unless you want to get together and pay for me to move, I am staying for a month\". Of course they didn\\'t pay, but during that month, my father got sick. The people were as sweet as can be.', \"The child was left home alone except for his/her siblings because his mum had gone shopping and his father had gone to (I think) take some horses back to their stables. Shortly after his mother left there was a huge crash and a window in the house was smashed. The child was afraid, but he managed to move the younger children into the stairwell where no stones could reach. He ran out to look for his mother who was shopping in the Jewish area, where shop-keepers worked long hours to maximise their income. He managed to find her and tell her what had happened. She asked for directions to the police station and she, and the child, went there. The police were sympathetic but unable to offer any help. They didn't expressly say it, but they indicated that the trouble was because the family are black and this is a predominantly Irish neighbourhood. Their only suggestion was that she move the family into a different area. The mother was indignant at this and pointed out that she could not afford to move again. As the police could not offer any help, she asked them to at least take her and the child home, which they did, in a noisy, horse-drawn police vehicle. The noise brought out all her neighbours, which gave the mdother the opportunity to address them all. She told them that she could not afford to move, she had paid a month's rent on the property and would be there for at least that time. After that, who knew. She was defiant and strong when she spoke to them, pointed out that other than skin colour they were the same and that she should be allowed to live there in peace.\", \"We moved onto Third and Wharton. My father drank a lot and when he took the team of horses, used to move us in, back, he then didn't return. My mother left the house to buy some food from the Jewish shop as they stayed open all hours. I was in charge of the children. I was ten years old. After my mother and father left, there was an almighty crash. A stone had been thrown through the window. I told the children to hide in the stairweel so that they wouldn't be injured. The house was stoned. I ran out of the house to find my mother. When I was telling her what happened, a policeman heard me. He said it was a rough area and that the Irish didn't want black people there, though he didn't say black. My mother asked him what he was going to do and he said there was nothing he could do and we should move. He was Irish too. My mother said we had spent the money on rent for a month so couldn't move. She asked him where his station was and we went there to see the captain but he said the same. The captain wasn't used to a black woman standing up for herself as most were cowed by the white people. She made him bring us home in the police patrol, which was a cart with horses. It was 1925. At the house, she told the people waiting that she would be there for the month as she had paid the rent and that, apart from being black, she was the same as them. Later, my father became ill and the neighbours were helpful. \", 'We arrived at 3rd & Wharton, it was olden times. We were in the front room when we heard a crash, looked and there was a stone in the middle of the room. They were smashing the windows. Mum took us to the stairs so we wouldn’t get hit by flying glass. We were told it was an Irish neighbourhood and they didn’t want black people there. Mum told them she had paid all the money she had to move in, so there was no way she would move out. She said it was the real estate agents fault. This was in 1925 and horse pulled police cabins. We rode in one and went home. It was a very terrifying experience for me.', \"In the 1920s, a boy was living with her mother and father and siblings in an irish neighborhood. they were a black family who rented in an irish neighborhood for a month, the boy's father went to attend the horses outside and the mother went to fourth street which is a market. The boy was home alone with just his younger siblings when he heard a loud noise crashing through the window. The loud crash was a rock that was thrown through the window. the boy managed to keep his siblings protected from the window glass by standing on the staircase. he was scared and ran outside to find his mom at fourth street.\\nWhen the boy found his mother there was surprisingly a policeman passing by. He managed to explain the story of what happened to the policeman and his mother. the policeman was understanding but mentioned that there was nothing he could do to help, probably due to the racial segregation existing at those times. The mother was relentless and opted to go to the nearest police station to find someone to help with this matter if this policeman can't. She went to the police station where they told her the same thing and suggested she moved out. She mentions she can't move out because she paid the rent for the month with her last money and asked the policeman take her home in his carriage instead. when she arrived she told the irish people in the neighborhood if the want her to leave they must collectively contribute enough money for her to move out because she doesn't have any money left over to move out. After her speech, the neighborhood treated her better and more neighborly after that.\", 'We move to a new neighbourhood. We made from a different neighbourhood as my dad was an alcoholic. We moved in and my dad went out to drink. My mum went out to go shopping. I was left at home. Then a stone came through the window and smash the window. I was scared. But I went outside and there were people. I didn’t know what to do. I had to look after the children. The children were in the hallway. I had to find my mum.\\n\\nMy mum had gone to a place a place where you can get what you want for money. A shop. My mum was shopping. I found my mum and tried to tell her what had happened. A police man had come by and tried to say what had happened. The policeman said this is a bad neighbourhood. People called us black but they didn’t say black back them. My mum asked the police man to help but he said he couldn’t help. He said we should move. This is a bad neighbourhood. This is an Irish neighbourhood. my mum said you need to find who did this. The policeman said he could not help you did not see them. You do not know who to blame. He told my mum that we should move. But she said she couldn’t move. She paid rent upfront. This is all the money she had. The estate agent is to blame if they didn’t want us living here they should’ve rented us the house. My mum told the police officer to take us back in the patrol car. We drove back home in the patrol car. When we got back home we had to get out the back of the patrol car. It was one of those ones that have steps to get out the back. As we were driving, the car goes, clang clang clang, that’s the sound of the car. When we got back all the neighbours had come out to see what was happening. My mum said that if you don’t want us here you can’t do anything I have rented this house. I have spent all my money on rent. I will be here for a month I can’t afford windows. my mum was smart. She went to high school. This is 1925. Soon after we moved in my dad got sick. The neighbours were supportive like you would expect. The neighbours did what you would expect neighbours to do. ', \"A black family is moving into a white neighborhood. Mom and Dad leave the house and someone throws a stone through the window while the kids are there. They have enough sense to run upstairs and the eldest decides to go look for their mother as they know where they are. The eldest finds the mother and they talk to a police officer who urges them to leave, the mom refuses and demands to be taken to the precinct. There she talks to the officer's superior and also ends up nowhere with him, this is when she asks to be taken home with a police patrol. When they get home, the neighbors are looking outside to see them and the mom gives them a piece of her mind. Some of the neighbors are nice and help the family and the dad becomes sick.\", \"The incident the narrator is telling took place in 1925 in New York City. The narrator was 10 years old at the time and he and his family had just rented a house and moved their furniture in. It was an IRish neighbourhood and not integrated. They must have been the first black family that had tried to live there. The father and the mother had had to go out separately on errands, leaving the narrator to look after his siblings. Suddenly a rock came through the front window, followed by a shower of other stones. The narrator hid his siblings on the stairs where they would be safe from flying glass and went out to find his mom, who was shopping in the Jewish neighbourhood a little way away. He was telling his mom about the attack when a policeman came by and heard their conversation. The policeman, who was Irish himself said that he couldn't do anything, especially since the narrator didn't know who had attacked them. The policeman said that the only thing they could do was move out of the neighbourhood. The mother stood up to the policeman and said she could not move for lack of money and that they had paid a month's rent in advance. Perhaps the real estate agent should not have rented them the house? Then they went to the police station, where the other policemen were equally unhelpful, advising them to move out. But the police drove them home and the whole neighbourhood saw them arrive in the police wagon. The mother then explained to the neighbours that she realized they were different but she couldn't move because it was winter and she had no money to go anywhere else. Eventually, the neighbours actually became helpful and showed the kind of solidarity neighbours should show to each other.\", \"A family moved to an Irish neighbourhood on a street called Wharton. One day when the father was out tending to the horses and the mom was out shopping, someone started throwing stones through the windows. The 10 year old child of the family told the other kids to hide so they wouldn't be hurt. The child then ran out to fifth street to search for their mom. Upon finding the mom, the mom then talks to a police officer and asks for help. The officer, who is also Irish, says that there is nothing he can do and implies that moving out of that neighbourhood is the best course of action. Unsatisfied with this answer, the mom goes to the police station to talk to someone higher up. She is received better here, but is still told nothing can be done because she didn't see who threw the stones. The officer gives the mom a ride back home in a carriage with the clanging bells. The mom then addresses the neighbourhood and tells them they will be there for at least the next month and so they should be more accepting of them.\", \"Honestly, that felt like pure nonsense and it's difficult to recall. I remember there were race issues. They were staying for a month. She didn't have any money to pay rent. She went to the police to complain. She was being kicked out of her place, and she just wanted a place for her family. Her son was telling the story. There was a lot of stuttering and repetition.\", \"We moved into a neighbourhood between Third and Walton, where mainly Irish people lived. My father was a drunk and used to manage the horses. One day when my mother had gone shopping, people began to throw stones at our house. We were scared and didn't know what to do. I went out to look for my mom who I spotted near a Jewish neighbourhood, their shops were always open till late because they wanted to make money. I told her what had happened when we spotted a policeman. My mom told him what had happened but he wasn't interested in helping us. He implied that people of our colour didn't belong in an Irish neighbourhood. My mom enquired about this his precinct and then we made our way there. We went through various cases ad they admitted that they couldn't help, so my mom asked them to take us back in a patrol car. When we returned, my mom spoke to the people in the neighbourhood and asked them to either give us enough money to move out or leave as be. Following this incident, we were able to move on and enjoy ourselves with the support of people in our neighbourhood.\", 'The story is told from the perspective of a 10-year-old child. The family, a mom, dad, and 2 - 3 children (not sure if it said), had just moved into a house in a predominately Irish area. The dad went out to check on the horses, while the mom went to the store down the road (on Fifth) that was run by Jewish people and open 24 hours. When the kids were home alone, somebody(ies) threw a rock into one of their windows. At this time, the narrator explains how they put their siblings into a room or closet nearby and told them that they would be safe there. The narrator then runs to the store their mom went to and starts explaining what was happening. A police officer arrives and they explain to the police officer what has happened. The police officer tells them that this neighborhood is Irish and that they do not like the new family living in that house because they are black. Since this was 1925, there has been A LOT of outward racial prejudice, racism, and oppression. The police officer told them to move, to which the mom had made him aware that they did not have enough money to move and that they spent all their money on the rent for this new place. The mom then asked to go to the precinct where this officer works and the officer took the mom and child to the precinct. Here, the mom spoke with another officer (possibly a supervisor) about the situation and got a pretty similar response. She reiterated that she had to spend all of the money paying for rent upfront. She also states that they should not have rented to her if they did not want her there and that the realtor should be liable. The police officer also asked the child if they saw the face of the person who threw the rock, to which the kid did not and the police officer stated they cannot do anything without anyone to blame. With this, the mom asked the officer to give them a ride home. The officer took them home in a horse and buggy with bells on it. The bells were being rung as they arrived home (making a \"clang\" sound, as described) and the neighbors were outside watching. The mom and child were let out, walking down the steps from the buggy/carriage to peering eyes. The mom then addressed people in the neighbourhood letting them know that the family will be there for the month since they have already paid, that they do not have enough money to move, and don\\'t know if they will even have enough money for next month\\'s rent. She then posited that if they do not want them to live there, they can raise the funds themselves to move them out. The narrator then continues to explain that nobody raised the funds themselves, speculating that they don\\'t have the money either and that the neighbors were being as \"normal\" or \"typical\" as one can hope. We also learn that the father falls ill. ', \"A family moved into a new neighbourhood, they were a black family, different from everyone else in the area which was composed of irish people. As soon as they moved into the house some locals threw stones through the family's windows causing the younger members of the family to be scared.\\nThe mother of the family requested help from the police officer, who was also irish and he wasn't very helpful, he seemed to share the same disdain for the family, though more veiled due to his position. The officers only solution to the familys predicament was to move away, the mother said she couldnt possibly since she has just moved in, paid for a months rent so told the officer and whoever else nearby that was listening that they have no choice but to accept that they will be there for at least a month and if they want them to leave that badly they should pool together enough money so they can afford to move away, they of course didn't do this since they are likely struggling just as much as them.\\nRelations within the community got a lot better, when the father became ill, the community was very attentive and helpful.\", \"Their father drank and mother went to get food but father didn't come home. I was there with the kids and my mother went out of the house too and then a crash happened and it was a big stone through our window. I went to find mom and I ran to fourth street in a Jewish neighborhood and I found my mom and then we talked to a cop who said you better move out of there it is a bad neighborhood and that he couldn't do anything to help my mom. Mom didn't have enough money to move though so the cops took us home and then mom said she has rented the house for a month so she told the cops that the only way she will move is if they give her the money to do so. Our neighbors were nice though and helped us out.\", \"The child was around 10 years old and had recently moved in to a rented house in a new neighbourhood. The child had been in the house with their siblings. The child's mother had gone to the shop and the child's father had gone to tend the horses. While the parents were away the house was stoned. The child tried to make their siblings safe and then left the house to find their mother.\\n\\nThey found the mother at the shop and while trying to communicate to her what had happened they were overheard by a policeman. The mother asked the policeman for assistance but he replied there was nothing he could do. He suggested that the family should move to another area (there appears to have been issues with racism in the neighbourhood). The mother advised that moving was unaffordable and went with the child to the police station to seek assistance.\\n\\nAt the police station the mother confronted another police officer and asked for assistance. The officer declined to investigate as no suspects had been identified. The officer was not prepared to make any effort to investigate or find the criminals. The mother is described as being educated, having completed high school and despite experiencing prejudice and discrimination was not afraid to try and secure her basic rights. \\n\\nThe mother requested that she and her child were transported back to the property in the police vehicle. The police vehicle was a horse drawn cart with a bell.\\n\\nOn arriving at the property the mother and child exited the police vehicle and the mother addressed her neighbours who had gathered nearby. She explained the she had paid a month rent and could not afford to move, nor could she afford the cost of window replacement. She acknowledged that despite the difference in her skin colour she had much in common with others in the neighbourhood.\\n\\nSpeaking frankly appears to have made an impact as the description of how the family were treated after this shows some improvement, especially when the father became ill. \", \"It was 1930 in the USA. I'm a black child aged 10 and we'd just moved into an Irish neighbourhood. My father had gone out and hadn't returned so we were worried. Suddenly, stones began hitting the windows, so my mother went out to see what was happening, and I went with her. We saw that people were throwing stones at our house. We found a police officer, who advised us to move out of the neighbourhood as we wouldn't be welcome.\\n\\nWe went to the police station to report the incident. My mother told the office in charge that the police should protect them. He asked if my mother had seen the face of anyone throwing stones. She said she hadn't, so the officer asked how he could punish anyone if he didn't know who to punish. \\n\\nMy mother asked him to drive us home, so he did. To my admiration, my mother said to the stone-throwers that we'd just moved in to the house and we didn't have enough money to pay to move out, so she asked the people to collectively find enough money to give us so we could move out. People didn't give us any money, but they did leave us alone. However, the whole experience made my father unwell.\", 'We had just gotten moved to Third and Horton. My mother went to get food and my father left with the horses - to take the pack of horses back. I was alone in the house with the kids. Then they started throwing the stones. I was so scared, I was only 10 years old. I got the kids out of there and ran and ran to Fourth which was a Jewish neighbourhood. Then I found my mother and told her what had happened.She told a policeman what had happened but I was so scared that my voice shook. He said, \"It\\'s an Irish neighbourhood, you\\'ll have to move\". My mother, the smartest person I know, she\\'s the only person I know that completed high school, she went to Lackawanna high school. My mother said she\\'s not moving, we just moved and haven\\'t got any money to move again. The policeman said we had to move. He was Irish himself. The year was around 1925 and times were what they were. My mother told him to drive us home in the patrol car, it went clang, clang a great bell that rang, clang, clang. A crowd of people were on the streets. My mother got out of the police patrol around where the horses came. She told the people that they we didn\\'t have enough money to move and if the people wanted her to move they had to get together and find the money for them to move. We already paid 1 months rent and couldn\\'t afford to move again. Of course that never happened and when my father got sick the neighbours were as nice as could be.', 'The brief summary of the story is that a family moved into a new neighborhood. When they arrived a stone was thrown into their window. The police arrived and explained to the family that it is because they are in an irish community. and that their kind if not welcome, they are most likely a black family. The cop says there is nothing they can do and suggest that the family moves. The family is in shock and cant believe that this how the police answered them.', 'The dad was a drunk and was at home and had to put the furniture in the right place.  Then the dad left and the mum left to go to the shops and they were left with the kids.  Then someone through stones thorough the window.  So they moved the kids to hide so they would not get hurt.  They went through the door but was scared as they did not know what would be thrown.  They went to look for they mom who was at fourth street.  The shops shut late as they wanted to make as much money as possible.  They found there mom and told them what happended it took a while to make her understand.  A policeman was passing and the sound of their voice stopped the policeman.  They told the policeman what happended and he said that it was a bad area the people were irish and they did not like black people.  They should move.  The mum said they had just moved there and could not afford to move.  the Policeman said there was nothing he could do, and the mum said where was the precint so she could find someone who could help her.  At the precint she spoke to the captain, he said there was nothing he could do and she should move.  the mum asked for a lift home and they were taken home by horse and cart and there was a clang noise from the cart.  Once home all the neighbours were watching and the mum asked them why they did what they did, and that she would be here for at least a month, as she had no money to move.  or if they wanted her to move they needed to give her the money to move.  While they were there the dad got sick and the neighbours were kind and helpful', \"They moved to third and wantan.
